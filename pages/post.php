  <p class="p-0">It took me 18 months to write <a class="text-dark-emphasis" href="#">The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck</a>. Over that time period, I wrote somewhere in the vicinity of 150,000 words for the book (about 600 pages). Most of that came in the final three months. In fact, I can confidently say I got far more done in the final three months than I did in the first 12 combined.

  <p class="p-0">Now, is that because I was on a deadline and worked like an insane person? Did I shove Adderall up my ass and work in 36-hour spurts or something?</p>

  <p class="p-0">No, <i>in fact</i>, those last three months, I worked less each day than I did the first 12, yet I still accomplished far more.</p>

  <p class="p-0">In this article, I'd like to make a simple argument (backed with lots of shitty images I created in MS Paint): that when it comes to productivity, things are not what they seem.</p>

  <p class="p-0">Every productivity book on the planet, from David Allen to Benjamin Franklin, tells you more or less the same thing: wake up at the ass-crack of dawn and drink some stimulating liquid, segment your work periods into bite-sized chunks organized by urgency and importance, keep fastidious lists and calendars, and schedule appointments 15 weeks in advance and be early to everything.</p>

  <p class="display-5 fst-italic fw-medium text-dark-emphasis p-0 mt-5 mb-0">Work as a linear function</p>

  <p class="p-0">So working two hours will produce twice the results as one hour. And eight hours will produce four times that of two hours.</p>

  <p class="p-0">We all kind of go through life assuming this is the way things work (for the most part). This is mostly because school work functions pretty linearly. They give you a bunch of stuff to memorize, and if you spend two hours memorizing it, you'll remember about twice as much as if you had spent one hour.</p>

  <p class="p-0">Then we get older and stop picking our noses in public and we just assume that the rest of life will function the same way.</p>

  <p class="p-0">But it doesn't.</p>

  <p class="p-0">The truth is that most thoughtful, brain-intensive work does not unfold like this. And this feels really unfair to us. So we spend a lot of time complaining to our parents and making excuses that our bosses don't appreciate our “genius” or whatever.</p>
