  <p class="p-0">It took me 18 months to write <a class="text-dark-emphasis" href="#">The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck</a>. Over that time period, I wrote somewhere in the vicinity of 150,000 words for the book (about 600 pages). Most of that came in the final three months. In fact, I can confidently say I got far more done in the final three months than I did in the first 12 combined.

  <p class="p-0">Now, is that because I was on a deadline and worked like an insane person? Did I shove Adderall up my ass and work in 36-hour spurts or something?</p>

  <p class="p-0">No, <i>in fact</i>, those last three months, I worked less each day than I did the first 12, yet I still accomplished far more.</p>

  <p class="p-0">In this article, I'd like to make a simple argument (backed with lots of shitty images I created in MS Paint): that when it comes to productivity, things are not what they seem.</p>

  <p class="p-0">Every productivity book on the planet, from David Allen to Benjamin Franklin, tells you more or less the same thing: wake up at the ass-crack of dawn and drink some stimulating liquid, segment your work periods into bite-sized chunks organized by urgency and importance, keep fastidious lists and calendars, and schedule appointments 15 weeks in advance and be early to everything.</p>

  <p class="display-5 fst-italic fw-medium text-dark-emphasis p-0 mt-5 mb-0">Work as a linear function</p>

  <p class="p-0">So working two hours will produce twice the results as one hour. And eight hours will produce four times that of two hours.</p>

  <p class="p-0">We all kind of go through life assuming this is the way things work (for the most part). This is mostly because school work functions pretty linearly. They give you a bunch of stuff to memorize, and if you spend two hours memorizing it, you'll remember about twice as much as if you had spent one hour.</p>

  <p class="p-0">Then we get older and stop picking our noses in public and we just assume that the rest of life will function the same way.</p>

  <p class="p-0">But it doesn't.</p>

  <p class="p-0">The truth is that most thoughtful, brain-intensive work does not unfold like this. And this feels really unfair to us. So we spend a lot of time complaining to our parents and making excuses that our bosses don't appreciate our “genius” or whatever.</p>

      <p class="fs-5">Excellent points Mark. I've spent years in my corporate job generally applying the 'diminishing returns' principle, opting to go home, play tennis, see friends or other fun things and come back fresh and ready to do quality work the next day, rather than sit until 10pm+ and churn out nothing but crap work and resentment.</p>

      <p class="fs-5">Great points, but I still don't give a fuck (yes, I read your book) about other people's ways of making things happen.</p>
